# Iteration

### Introduction

Iterate literally means 'to perform repeatedly'. While human beings get bored of doing something repeatedly, machines excel at it.

To "iterate over a list" means to perform the same task over and over again, once for each item in the list.

The main way to iterate over a list in python is the `for ___ in ____` method we looked at earlier.

### Try it out

The challenges and the datasets are all in a file called `iterate.py`, and you'll be writing your own print statements.

To test your code, type `python iterate.py` in the console.
